description: >
  The foundation carvings are far older than the current bird-folk shrine.
  Half-scrubbed military sigils match the Scars of Verdeth, and one fresh symbol—
  painted in ash and oil—was left in haste.
reward: >
  Gain leverage: proof of the Scars of Verdeth’s involvement, tradable as
  evidence, rumor, or blackmail in Fort Dendras.
insight: >
  The Scars were here recently and wanted their claim noticed; the ash-mark
  still smolders, signaling an active stake in the site.

description: >
  Disturbed soil rings a cracked altar; scraps of cloth and broken restraints
  litter the floor, a coppery stench hanging in the air. A husk-hand briefly
  thrusts from the dirt before falling still.
insight: >
  The Scars unearthed what should not wake; the Carrion Harvesters stir beneath
  the stone.
cost: >
  Each investigator loses 1 Hope. The husks have scented the living—their rise is
  only a matter of time.

  A hidden wall niche holds cracked crates bearing the Verdeth seal. A torn
  parchment lists quantities of “harvest units” beside harsh tally marks.
reward: >
  You notice movement early—something is coming—so you are not ambushed.
consequence: >
  Your rummaging echoes through the halls, drawing husks or a hostile patrol.
cost: >
  Danger escalates as opposition converges on your location; clocks relevant to
  the Scars or local husk activity advance.
